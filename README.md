The notbook in this repository contains the code for a Kaggle in-class competision. 
The goal was to predict the category of scientific research papers. Due to coppy right issues, the dataset was not provided in this repository. There are 40 categories 
each given a numerical id. The labels correspond to categorisation into different subject areas. For each paper, there is an id, the title, and the abstract. 
For this text classification problem, I used pre-trained transfer models and my two best models were found to be "roberta_large" and "deberta_large". 
More details on the results can be found inside the notebook.
